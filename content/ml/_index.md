<!-- *Machine Learning* (ML) can broadly be defined as a set of techniques that involves tuning the parameters of a model to satisfy a user defined objective.
Under this definition, regression can be thought of as a ML model that is fitted to minimize some distance metric between the model predictions and the observations used to train the model.
In the case of linear regression the parameters that we are fitting are the slope and the intercept.
A *Neural Network* (NN) is an example of a class of ML models typically parameterized by a set of weights and biases,   -->
